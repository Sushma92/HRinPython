/*
Task 
You are given a complex . Your task is to convert it to polar coordinates.

Input Format

A single line containing the complex number z. Note: complex() function can be used in python to convert the input as a complex number.

Constraints

Given number is a valid complex number

Output Format

Output two lines: 
The first line should contain the value of x. 
The second line should contain the value of y.
